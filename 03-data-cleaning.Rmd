# Data Cleaning

## Excel Numeric Dates Mixed With Character

Sometimes columns may be read in with both excel numeric dates and character dates by default. This code looks for a forward slash to distinguish which is which and converts accordingly. This may not work for all data formats but catches most cases I come across.   

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)

data <- tibble::tribble(
  ~id, ~messy_date,
  1L,     "43381",
  2L,     "43699",
  3L,     "43665",
  4L,     "43827",
  5L,     "43911",
  6L, "5/10/2019",
  7L,     "44037",
  8L,     "44151",
  9L,     "44105"
)

data %>%
  dplyr::mutate(clean_date = 
           case_when(
             str_detect(messy_date, fixed('/')) ~ mdy(messy_date), 
             TRUE ~ janitor::excel_numeric_to_date(as.numeric(messy_date))))

```
