# About

This is an encyclopedia of useful R code snippets (a.k.a. "codelets"), written in **Markdown**. 

## Usage 

This is meant to be an easily accessible reference guide for all the bits of code I can never remember. Chapters most often will contain several snippets each are organized by usage (e.g. [Data Cleaning]) or package (e.g. [{ggplot}]). All code examples should be reprex.
